>This document describes a reference methodology for modern agile digital enterprises.  Our goal is to move organizations from the current maturity stage towards the integration agile stage.  The outcome of moving higher in the maturity model is to increase the productivity of employees, save costs by reallocating resources from a “center of excellence” to self-organized teams, and provide a better customer experience by being digitally aligned. The methodology for moving through these maturity stages involves people, process and technology.

## Introduction

As APIs, microservices, software as a service (SaaS), and serverless architectures evolve, integration is not fading away; instead almost every new application involves integration across an exploding set of endpoints. The microservices mantra of smart endpoints and dumb pipes fundamentally addresses a deeper problem. Integration must learn from code to become immutable, type safe, testable, continuously built and deployed  so they are more robust, resilient and above all - agile.

## A Methodology

A methodology formalizes an approach to achieve a particular goal or set of goals. Our end goal is to make an organization integration agile. The proposed methodology is an iterative process characterized by five stages. Additionally, the methodology defined in this document looks at the organizational improvements in three dimensions.

The methodology does not expect an organization to start from scratch, but rather to first conduct an assessment to understand the current state and define a path to move to the next desired level. This paper outlines a meta-process for organizations to refer and become integration agile.

## Maturity Model

A maturity model defines how an organization can measure the current stage of integration agility and defines a direction for improvement in three dimensions: people, process, and technology. There are two foundational elements for enabling the continuous improvement of an organization and move to the right in the maturity model:

+ For both people and process the foundation is the culture of an organization.

+ For technology the foundation is the architecture designed and implemented by the organization.

### Summary view

|  | Monolithic | Fast Waterfall | API-Driven | Early Agility | Integration Agile |
|---------|---------|---------|--------|--------|-------|
|**People**|Centralized|COE|API Teams|Decentralized|Self-Organised Teams|
|**Process**|Waterfall|Fast Waterfall|API Iterative|Semi-Continuous|Continuous|
|**Technology**|Silo|EAI/ESB|API-Driven|Early Agility|Continuous Agility|
|**Digital Alignment**|Separate|Ad-hoc|Early Strategic|Digital-First|Adaptive|

The maturity model defined here contains five stages, and each stage is defined in three dimensions. Let's look at each dimension in detail. 

### People

People and their ability to define solutions by understanding the current situation is the most important thing for an organization. Culture and the organizational structure control the way people operate, and it is the platform for enabling people’s productivity. Culture plays an important role in adapting to change. Habits and best practices inherited from an organization’s culture are more powerful than those merely enforced by policies.
